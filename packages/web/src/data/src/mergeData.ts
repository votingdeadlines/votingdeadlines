    //     - https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/16/00134.htm
    //     - C.
    //       - 1. Must be postmarked >=29 days before an election and received
    //            by 7pm on election day
    //       - 2. Must be dated >=29 days before an election and received no
    //            more than 5 days late
    //
    // This is complex, but basically you should have your registration
    // _postmarked_ by the cutoff date, with about 5 days of wiggle room, and
    // if it doesn't arrive until after election day it won't count.
    //
    // This level of complexity seems absent from the ruling, which just says,
    // "accept all voter registrations received by 5pm on 10/23". It's unclear.
    // It might be more conservative to assume "received by 10/23", and more
    // optimistic to assume that "postmarked by 10/23" will be acceptable.
