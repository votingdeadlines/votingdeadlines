            If an individual becomes qualified to vote between the registration
            deadline (the 25th day before Election Day) and Election Day, then
            the individual may apply to register on Election Day by submitting
            an application to: a member of the county board of elections, the
            county director of elections, or the chief judge or a judge of the
            precinct in which the person is eligible to vote. If the application
            is approved, the individual may vote the same day. This applies to
            those individuals who recently become naturalized citizens of the
            U.S. or who have restored to citizenship after a felony conviction,
            but it does not apply to individuals who were 17 years old and reach
            18 after the registration deadline.

              Wyoming does not accept the National Voter Registration Form so
              please do not use our
              <a href="/register-to-vote/" target="_blank"
                >Register to Vote Tool</a
              >
              to register to vote in Wyoming.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wyoming prefers that people register to vote in person at the
              County Clerk's office.
            </li>
            <li>
              If this isn't possible, print out the Wyoming Voter Registration
              form and fill it out in front of a notary. That part is really
              important! Your Wyoming Voter Registration Form MUST be notarized.
              Print clearly, using a black or blue ink pen (not felt tip).
            </li>
            <li>
              Sign the voter registration oath on the form and have the notary
              or registered agent sign the form.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make copies of the identification documents you showed to the
              notary.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mail the voter registration form, along with the copies of your ID
              documents, to
              <a
                href="https://sos.wyo.gov/Elections/Docs/WYCountyClerks.pdf"
                target="_blank"
                >your County Clerk</a
              >. Note: Sending your form to any other office will delay your
              voter registration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mail your form as soon as possible. Voter registration closes two
              weeks prior to Election Day.
            </li>
